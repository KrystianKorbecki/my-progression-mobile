# Description
The my-progression-mobile app will be used to monitor workouts. In the app you will be able to create your own training plan, with appropriate exercises and monitor your progress. For aerobic exercises performed outdoors, GPS tracking will be available using an API from Google Maps. The back-end for the mobile application is under construction, it will allow logging into the application using JWT tokens, synchronising data on completed workouts between different devices. There are also plans to make a panel for trainers and nutritionists who, after being subscribed by the mentee, will help him/her achieve the goal.
